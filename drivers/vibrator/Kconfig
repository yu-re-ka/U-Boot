config VIBRATOR
	bool "Enable VIBRATOR support"
	depends on DM
	help
	  Many boards have VIBRATORs which can be used to signal status or alerts.
	  U-Boot provides a uclass API to implement this feature. VIBRATOR drivers
	  can provide access to board-specific VIBRATORs. Use of the device tree
	  for configuration is encouraged.

config SPL_VIBRATOR
	bool "Enable VIBRATOR support in SPL"
	depends on SPL && SPL_DM
	help
	  The VIBRATOR subsystem adds a small amount of overhead to the image.
	  If this is acceptable and you have a need to use VIBRATORs in SPL,
	  enable this option. You will need to enable device tree in SPL
	  for this to work.

config VIBRATOR_GPIO
	bool "VIBRATOR support for GPIO-connected VIBRATORs"
	depends on VIBRATOR && DM_GPIO
	help
	  Enable support for VIBRATORs which are connected to GPIO lines. These
	  GPIOs may be on the SoC or some other device which provides GPIOs.
	  The GPIO driver must used driver model. VIBRATORs are configured using
	  the device tree.

config SPL_VIBRATOR_GPIO
	bool "VIBRATOR support for GPIO-connected VIBRATORs in SPL"
        depends on SPL_VIBRATOR && DM_GPIO
	help
	  This option is an SPL-variant of the VIBRATOR_GPIO option.
	  See the help of VIBRATOR_GPIO for details.
